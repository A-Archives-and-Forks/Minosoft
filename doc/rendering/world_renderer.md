# World Renderer

- Frustum culling
  - 2 algorithms
    - Fast one (old one): Only tell if it could be in the frustum
    - -> If yes (or no; depends on algo) use complex one to check
  - extreme chunk section values (most east[â€¦] block; highest block; lowest block)
  - "Cave algorithm"
- 3 Meshes per section (opaque; transparent; translucent)
- Preparing in nearer to further away order
  - unload meshes if block changed and not in frustum
  - only prepare if chunk is in frustum
  - don't prepare empty chunks
- Light
  - Client side light engine
  - Lightmap
- Transparency
  - Sort faces
  - 2 render modes: Fast/Default
    - No block transparency
- water logged & FluidFillable properties
- Force interrupt preparing if needed (e.g. new block change; light change; more important task in thread pool)
- "Resolving" of block models
- Chunk cache clearing (default F3 + A)
  - Respawn
- texture animations
- require neighbour chunks loaded
  - Also don't load if block changes in chunk (e.g. when movement is disabled and walking to chunk border and destroying block)
- View distance
  - Server side
  - Client side
- Rewrite renderers
- Check neighbour positions
- Cache biomes
- "Fast biome" in 19w36a+
- Improved biome blending
- Performance optimizations
  - Don't render bedrock on y == dimension::minHeight
- Meshing
  - Greedy meshing
- Model deciding (for pre flattening versions)
- Assets manager: Create file from jar with all models inside and load models from there (make them moddable)
